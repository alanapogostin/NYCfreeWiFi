### Installing Packages

library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)

### Loading up the data set about internet adoption
Internet_Adoption <- read_csv("Internet_Master_Plan__Adoption_and_Infrastructure_Data_by_Neighborhood.csv")

###Taking the spaces in column names
Internet_Adoptions <- clean_names(Internet_Adoption)

#### A Summary of the Dataset to see the amount of neighborhoods
summary(Internet_Adoption)

######Figuring out which Borough Has the Most Neighborhoods with below average household broadband adoption###############

###Finding the mean for internet Adoption rate so we have a baseline for identifying neighborhoods with lower home broadband adoption percentages
mean(Internet_Adoption$home_broadband_adoption_percentage_of_households) #0.6867692
##Trying to filter out the neighborhoods with below average
Internet_Adoption_Below_Avg <- filter(Internet_Adoptions, home_broadband_adoption_percentage_of_households < 0.6867692)

#Selecting Columns of Interest: Neighborhoods with below average, borough,
Internet_Adoption_Below_Avg_sum <- select(Internet_Adoption_Below_Avg, borough_name, home_broadband_adoption_percentage_of_households, total_number_of_households)
Internet_Adoption_Below_Avg_sum <- group_by(Internet_Adoption_Below_Avg_sum, borough_name, .add = TRUE)
Internet_Adoption_Below_Avg_sum <- Internet_Adoption_Below_Avg_sum %>%
  group_by(borough_name) %>%
  summarise(
    precent_broadband_households = mean(home_broadband_adoption_percentage_of_households),
    count_of_below_avg_neighborhoods = n(),
