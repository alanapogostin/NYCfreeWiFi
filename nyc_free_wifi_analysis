###Taking the spaces in column names

######Figuring out which Borough Has the Most Neighborhoods with below average household broadband adoption###############

###Finding the mean for internet Adoption rate so we have a baseline for identifying neighborhoods with lower home broadband adoption percentages
mean(Internet_Adoption$home_broadband_adoption_percentage_of_households) #0.6867692
##Trying to filter out the neighborhoods with below average

Internet_Adoption_Below_Avg <- filter(Internet_Adoptions, home_broadband_adoption_percentage_of_households < 0.6867692)

#Selecting Columns of Interest: Neighborhoods with below average, borough
